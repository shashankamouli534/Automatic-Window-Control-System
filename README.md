# Automatic-Window-Control-System
The primary objective of this project is to create an advanced and
inventive automated window control system that significantly improves
the comfort level within a room. This improvement is achieved through
the implementation of intelligent window operations that respond
dynamically to changes in temperature and can be controlled using
voice commands.
Our project aims to use raspberry pi 3 model B+ to use Wi-Fi modules
in it. The room has a temperature sensor (DHT11), and the system can
get information on local temperatures from the Internet. Based
on the difference in temperature, the system sends a signal to open/close
the windows to the continuous servo motors. Two servo motors are attached at the ends of the window
connected by a chain, and from the signal received, one of the motors
rotates a fixed number of rotations previously coded. Small suction
hooks attach a part of the chain to the window. This would let air flow
happen/stop, which gives desired output.
There is a voice-recognized system that makes the system user control.
There are four commands for the user, namely manual,open, close, and
automate, which will perform as they are called. The hierarchy goes as follows Voice controlled, temperature controlled.
Ultimately, the project's essence is to create an automated window
control system that adapts intelligently to changing temperature
conditions, thereby ensuring an optimal room environment. Through the
amalgamation of temperature sensing, voice recognition, and precise
control mechanisms, this project aspires to transform how window
management is approached, making it more efficient, intuitive, and
user-centric.
